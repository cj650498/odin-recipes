    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Chop three-quarters of the onion coarsely; reserve the remaining.
        Cut cilantro stems into 1-inch pieces. Process chopped onion, cilantro stems, ginger, garlic, and half the serranos in a food processor until finely chopped (about 20 seconds). Transfer mixture to a saucepan with oil and cook over medium-high heat, stirring often, for 5 to 7 minutes until softened and just starting to stick.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, process the tomatoes with juice in the same food processor until smooth (about 30 seconds).
        Add chile powder, cumin, turmeric, and fennel seeds to the saucepan. Cook, stirring, for 1 minute until fragrant.
        Add chickpeas with their liquid and the tomato mixture. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, covered, for 15 minutes.
        While that cooks, finely chop the reserved onion quarter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in garam masala and salt. Simmer uncovered for 8 to 12 more minutes until thickened and chickpeas are tender.
        Taste and season with more salt if needed. Transfer to a serving bowl. Top with the reserved onion, remaining serranos, and cilantro leaves. Serve with lime wedges.
